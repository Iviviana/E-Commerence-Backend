## Description

This assignment had me build the backend of an E-commerce site using MySQL, Express,  and Sequelize.

## Installation

Clone the repository on to your device:

`git clone https://github.com/Iviviana/E-Commerence-Backend`

[Here's](https://github.com/Iviviana/E-Commerence-Backend) a link to the repository as well.

Run `npm install` to install all packages from the `package.json`, and run `npm run seed` to install the seeds.

Aside from this code, you will require MySQL, MAMP, and Insomnia to be able to run this web application.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to start MAMP and start your MySQL database from the schema.

Once that is up and running, start the server.js by using `npm start`. Once it's up and running use Insomnia to add, delete and create information on MySQL. The server default uses `localhost:3001`, if yours is different make sure to change it. Below is a small demo that is demonstrating the capabilities it can reach.

No tests have been made for this application.
